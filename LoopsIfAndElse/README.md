# LearnFORTRAN
This is a project aimed on teaching FORTRAN to anyone by practicing!

This is a side project on learning FORTRAN from the perspective of a 
physics grad student! Do not expect a perfect code but instead see this
as an introduction on how to learn the basics to code in FORTRAN. 

The beauty of FORTRAN is that it follows very simple rules and syntaxis.
You do NOT need to know how to code to understand a FORTRAN code, at least
a basic one, which is what we are gonna aim for.

There are many ways to teach how to code but just one to learn it, 
and that's by practicing! 

The way this project will help you learn to code in FORTRAN is by 
developing a single code that will englobe everything you need to 
learn to start writing your own FORTRAN codes! I encourage you to 
go through each code, although they might seem basic it is important
to follow each step so you don't miss steps or tips!
Before we begin it is important to point some things!

FORTRAN requires a compiler to run, for which you need to install the so called compiler on your computer OR you can use an online compiler like [ONLINEDGB](https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_fortran_compiler). I recommend you use the online compiler for your first programs before getting into the trouble of installing the compiler. Whenever you are ready to install it, you can go [HERE](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran) or look for a recent youtube tutorial, which I would recommend best, to be honest. You can also go to your local college and ask a C.S. professor or even a grad student for help, they will likely help you out (this of course if you want to install it on a laptop, don't bring your desktop to school!).

I work with [vim](https://www.vim.org) as my main text editor directly on the terminal of my mac, if you are using windows you can use any text editor, I believe [notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) is a great option in general, because of many features it has regarding coding, like syntax highlighting and auto-completion. I personally don't mind not having auto-completion but the highlighting is very helpful.

Coding is a skill that must be learned and practiced in a regular basis, I have learned to code FORTRAN more than once because I stopped using it in more than one ocassion. This project will help you to make it easier to remember how to write FORTRAN code if you ever forget it!
