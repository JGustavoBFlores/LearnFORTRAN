# LearnFORTRAN
This is a project aimed on teaching FORTRAN to anyone by practicing!

This is a side project on learning FORTRAN from the perspective of a 
physics grad student! Do not expect a perfect code but instead see this
as an introduction on how to learn the basics to code in FORTRAN. 

The beauty of FORTRAN is that it follows very simple rules and syntaxis.
You do NOT need to know how to code to understand a FORTRAN code, at least
a basic one, which is what we are gonna aim for.

Before we begin it is important to point some things!
